2. **TR2‑2 HRC** beats all its CS‑tagged versions (TR2‑3 HRC, TR2‑1 HRC CS 90, TR2‑2 HRC CS 90, TR2‑3 HRC CS 90). It is cheaper, shorter, and better than **TR2‑2 HRC CS 95** and has the same number of tasks as **TR2‑3 HRC**.

3. All CS‑tagged plans (e.g., TR1‑1 HRC CS 90, TR2‑2 HRC CS 95, TR2‑1 HRC CS 90, TR2‑3 HRC CS 90) are slower, longer, more expensive, and lower quality than their corresponding non‑CS plans, but they share the same task count.

4. **TR1‑3 HRC** and **TR2‑3 HRC** are outperformed by **TR1‑1 HRC** on all metrics.

### What “better” means
- **Cheaper** – lowest cost.
- **Faster** – the shortest total time (makespan).
- **Shorter** – fewer hours overall.
- **Better** – higher quality values for makespan, tasks, and cost.

All plans are of type **TypicalPlan** except **TR2 1 HRC CS 95**, which is **Atypical**.

- The remaining plans (TR1‑1 HRC CS 90, TR1‑2 HRC CS 90, TR1‑3 HRC CS 90, and the various TR2‑1/2 HRC variants) do not match TR2‑3 HRC CS 90’s superior performance.

• TR1 1 HRC CS 90** – Cheaper, shorter and better than TR1 1 HRC CS 95 and also better than TR2 3.

• TR1 1 HRC CS 95** – Similar cost to TR2 3, but slower and uses more tasks.

• TR1 2 HRC CS 95** – More costly than TR1 2 HRC CS 90, slower, and has more tasks.

• TR1 3 HRC CS 90** – Same cost as TR2 3, but longer and slower.

• TR2 1 HRC CS 95** – Cost and task count similar to TR1 1 HRC CS 90; it is slower and longer compared to the higher‑ranked plans.

In short, the ranking from best to worst is: **TR2 2 → TR2 3 → TR1 2 → TR1 1 → TR1 1 HRC CS 95 → TR1 2 HRC CS 95 → TR1 3 HRC CS 90 → TR2 1**. All comparisons preserve the same quantitative facts but are now presented in a concise, easy‑to‑read format.","Removed many redundant repeated comparisons, shortened phrases such as “cheaper plan than and is shorter plan than” to single verbs, eliminated verbatim values for makespan, cost, and tasks, and expressed the relationships as a concise hierarchical summary. The narrative now uses simpler language, fewer clauses, and keeps the same semantic meaning.","Cut the narrative to its core facts using concise bullet points, omitted repeated cost, makespan, and task values beyond the two key plans, and removed narrative flow to keep only the ranking and key attributes.","Rewrote comparisons as a clear, ordered list, used plain language, kept all semantic facts, and added brief explanation of what each order means.",gpt-oss:20b
pair_152,"Plan TR1 3 HRC CS 95 is more expensive, longer, slower, and overall worse than plan TR2 3 HRC CS 95. Its makespan is 47.96 (worse than TR2’s 42.99). It also has 17 tasks (one more than TR2’s 16) and costs $5 (more than TR2’s $4). \n\nTR1 3 HRC CS 95 is slower and worse than the plans TR1 3 HRC CS 90, TR1 1 HRC CS 95, and TR1 2 HRC CS 95, and it also costs more and takes longer than those two plans. \n\nTR2 3 HRC CS 95 shares the same cost ($4) and the same number of tasks (16) as TR1 1 HRC CS 95.
","Plan TR1 3 HRC CS 95 is more expensive ($5 vs $4), longer (47.96 min vs 42.99 min make‑span), slower, and has one more task (17 vs 16) than TR2 3 HRC CS 95. It is also worse, slower, and costlier than TR1 3 HRC CS 90, TR1 1 HRC CS 95, and TR1 2 HRC CS 95, and shares the same cost and task count with TR1 1 HRC CS 95.","Plan **TR1 3 HRC CS 95** is not as good as plan **TR2 3 HRC CS 95**: it costs **$5** instead of **$4**, takes **47.96** units of time instead of **42.99**, and requires **17 tasks** instead of **16**.  All of these make it slower, longer, more expensive, and overall worse. \n\nComparing **TR1 3 HRC CS 95** with other TR1 plans: it is slower, longer, and more expensive than **TR1 3 HRC CS 90**, **TR1 1 HRC CS 95**, and **TR1 2 HRC CS 95**.
