**Main facts**
1. **TR1 1 HRC**  outperforms every other plan in every dimension: it is the cheapest, shortest (fewest tasks), quickest (lowest makespan) and best overall.
2. **TR2 2 HRC** is next best: it has 3.0 cost, 15 tasks, makespan 30.54, and is faster, cheaper, and better than the CS‑90 and CS‑95 variants.
3. All CS‑90 and CS‑95 variants are slower, longer, and more expensive than the base plans.
4. The number of tasks of the base plans (TR1 1 HRC and TR2 1 HRC) equals 12, while all CS variants have 15 tasks.
5. Makespan values: TR1 1 HRC = 26.90; TR2 2 HRC = 30.54; TR1 2 HRC CS 90 = 40.97; the rest fall between 31–37.

**Key metrics for TR2‑2‑HRC**
- Makespan: 28.95 units (vs 43.99 for TR1‑2‑HRC‑CS‑95)
- Tasks: 12 (vs 16 for TR1‑2‑HRC‑CS‑95)
- Cost: lower than all TR1‑2‑HRC‑CS‑95 comparisons (exact value not specified but considered cheaper)

**Other comparisons**
- *TR2‑3‑HRC* is also cheaper, shorter and faster than the TR1‑**HRC** plans and TR2‑1‑HRC‑CS‑95.
- *TR1‑1‑HRC*, *TR1‑2‑HRC*, *TR1‑3‑HRC* and *TR2‑1‑HRC* all have the same number of tasks as *TR2‑2‑HRC*.
